During this Bootcamp, I have developed several key skills, including:

The Bootcamp has been a transformative experience. It not only strengthened my technical foundation but also encouraged me to think critically, collaborate effectively, and take ownership of projects. I am excited about the future and ready to apply these skills in a professional environment.
